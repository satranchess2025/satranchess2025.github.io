The most common plan here is 7. Nc2 to play 8. Bd3 next and still not letting the IQP after cxd4.

7\. Nc4 Be7 8. Nce5 O-O 9. Be2

A new move to be able to capture with the queen, white did not play 10.Bd3.

9... cxd4 10. Qxd4 Qxd4 11. Nxd4

A rather typical queenless middlegame position from Alapin Sicilian. Both sides have their pawn majorities on each side of the board.

11... Nd5!

The first instructive moment of the game for me as 11... Nbd7 looked more normal to play. Black immediately starts moving their pawn majority by playing f6 and e5 thus avoid simplifications.
